WP Basic Elements is a WordPress plugin that simplifys your WP Admin and cleans your markup in the code for faster loadtime.

With WP Basic Elements you can disable unnecessary features and speed up your site. Make the WP Admin simple and clean. 

You can activate gzip compression, change admin footers in backend, activate shortcodes in widgets, remove admin toolbar options and you can clean the code markup from unnecessary code snippets like WordPress generator meta tag and a bunch of other non important code snippets in the code.
